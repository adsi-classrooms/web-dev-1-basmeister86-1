				I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a
				normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. It's a fez. I wear
				a fez now. Fezes are cool. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society
				Awful?'! You've swallowed a planet! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine
				and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.
				Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.

				You've swallowed a planet! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And
				that is not how I'm introducing myself. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.
				Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. No… It's a thing; it's like a
				plan, but with more greatness. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. It's a fez. I wear a fez now.
				Fezes are cool. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the
				Doctor too. I still don't know why. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister.
				No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't
				Modern Society Awful?'! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Stop talking, brain thinking.
				Hush. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I
				still don't know why. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Annihilate?
				No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the
				Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? You hit me with
				a cricket bat. You've swallowed a planet! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I'm nobody's taxi
				service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
